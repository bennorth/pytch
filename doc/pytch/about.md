# Pytch

## Summary

Pytch provides a stepping-stone in the journey from Scratch to Python.


## Motivation

The two most common teaching languages are Scratch and Python.
Learners often start by working with Scratch, and then at some point
want to make a transition to a text-based programming language; Python
is a common choice.

Many factors make the transition from Scratch to Python a difficult
one.  Simplifying, we can see that there are two substantial
differences:

 * Instead of assembling their program via drag and drop of
   interlocking blocks, the learner must type code into a text editor,
   attending to spelling, syntax, and so on.
 * Instead of an environment providing a set of concurrently running
   sprites, with built-in behaviours such as movement, costumes, and
   collision detection, the learner must work with an entirely new
   runtime, with a very different programming model.

Currently, the learner must make both these changes to their
understanding at the same time.


## Pytch's contribution

We break this leap into two smaller steps.  Pytch provides a
programming environment with the familiarity of Scratchâ€™s model and
runtime, but where behaviour is expressed using textual Python code
rather than blocks.  Pytch projects resemble Scratch projects, with a
Stage and as many interacting Sprites as required.  The learner can
concentrate on becoming familiar with Python's syntax.


## Status

The implementation is at the prototype stage.  We would very much
welcome feedback from people with experience of both Scratch and
Python, particularly those involved in education!
